The presidential election comprises many factors, and the motivations to vote for a candidate depend on many factors. Usually, a voter will choose a candidate that represents his best interest and direction he wants to see his country usher in. Although some of our data hints to correlation between different factors, we cannot state for sure that causation is part of our discoveries. Indeed, many factors played a role in this election, ranging from Trump’s popularity among the new generation that grew up surrounded by the liberal movements of universities; to protests for civil rights for minorities (in particular the Black Lives Matter) that saw a second birth this year during the summer. To assume causation, more research would’ve been necessary, such as the impact of the virus on the economy. As a group of 3, we preferred not to expand our research this far, fearing that it would make our research on other topics weaker. We preferred focusing on three main points, that targeted the general issues linked to an election, campaigning, approval ratings, and voting itself. It was difficult as well to find suitable datasets for specific points, as many we found were available as PDF files only, which would make the research and data manipulation too long and complicated.
