2020 has been a tumultuous year for most countries in the world. The COVID-19 virus, declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) triggered extreme responses from the countries whose population was contaminated. The media is still as of this day reporting daily on the progression of the fight against the virus. It only seemed to interesting for each of our group members to agree on studying the virus for this task. This group discussed and concluded that the virus as a mean to influence politics was underestimated. During our debate to find an area or event influenced by the virus, the United States’ (U.S.) Presidential Campaign was continuing its course, with the vote taking place in November. Since we are a part of a generation surrounded by the social media that was often reporting on the campaign, we thought it could be interesting to analyse the impact that COVID-19 had on the campaign and election. The fact that COVID-19 was talked about during the first Presidential debate and in Donald Trump’s ranting on Twitter confirmed that there would be some interesting points to analyse. After some initial searches on data, we found public datasets that depict the mail-voting system, the rallies held by the candidates and the overall view of the American population on the government. 
As a group composed of three members, we instinctively turned ourselves towards three main parts to divide the project into – the voting, the campaigning and the politics about COVID-19. We felt that these three topics would demonstrate the influence of the pandemic on an event that will shape America for the better or the worse in the four next years to come.
