At the beginning and throughout the year 2020, Donald Trump was sure of a victory. In fact, America’s economy was booming during the first three years of his term. We wish to understand if Covid-19 played a role in his downfall; not just for us but as well for curious readers that want to add depth to their knowledge about the relationship between Trump’s presidency and the pandemic. 
Our Hypothesis is: Trump’s handling of Covid-19 disappointed the American population, worsening the situation which backfired on Trump, emphasizing the gap between both political parties.
The goal of this website is to project the reader within America during the campaign under every angle possible given our available resources. We want to give an idea of what surrounded Americans in this period of political conflict and tensions. The campaign influences Americans in many ways. The presidential candidates can go meet their supporters physically during rallies, which is a physical contact. The candidates can display their political agendas on social networks (such as Twitter), which means they influence potential voters at any time during the day, regardless of where they are in the country. The current president, Trump, had to deal with a global pandemic. The way in which he handled the virus can influence a voter, as he experiences first-hand how Trump will continue to approach disastrous issues like it. With retrospect, he is introduced as well to the measures another candidate (Joe Biden) will enforce. This feeling of engulfment of the Americans in the time of a campaign during a pandemic is what we are trying to reproduce with this website.
